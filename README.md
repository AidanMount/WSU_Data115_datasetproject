# WSU Data115 Final - Wine Quality
@author Aidan Mount

This repository contains my final project in which I will be using R to analyze wine content data. The question I seek to answer is "What factors have the most significant impact on wine quality, and how are they related?".
Currently, the repository contains 2 files excluding the README.

## rwine.csv
- Contains over 1500 entries detailing red wine content and quality
- Contains columns "fixed.acidity", "volatile.acidity", "citric.acid" , "residual.sugar", "chlorides", "free.sulfur.dioxide", "total.sulfur.dioxide" "density", "pH", "sulphates",  "alcohol", and "quality"

## wwine.csv
- Contains over 4800 entries detailing white wine content and quality
- Contains columns "fixed.acidity", "volatile.acidity", "citric.acid" , "residual.sugar", "chlorides", "free.sulfur.dioxide", "total.sulfur.dioxide" "density", "pH", "sulphates",  "alcohol", and "quality"

The data sets were supplied from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository on red and white Vinho Verde wine sample quality from wines north of Portugal.
